I want to thank Professor Gabriele Bavota for suggesting this topic for my Bachelor project, as well as providing me with guidance throughout its development.
Working on this tool, although the greatest challenge I faced thus far, allowed me to apply all the skills I have obtained over the course my studies here, as well as expand my knowledge of working on large-scale collaborative projects.
I am also extremely grateful to Dr Emad Aghajani, as his continued suggestions and feedback kept the development moving at a steady pace.
I would also like to thank Dr Csaba Nagy for assisting in the deployment of the final product.
The positive experience I had working with the research team makes me excited for future projects in the Software and Data Engineering Master's programme.
Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends for all the support they have shown throughout my studies.
Without their encouragement, I probably would not have made it this far in the first place.
