In order for researchers to study the code of open source projects, they must first select a preliminary sample of repositories to study.
While there are many tools that can aid in this selection, they tend to exhibit several prevailing flaws that complicate efficient use.

The goal of this project is to produce a full-stack web application that would address these limitations, allowing the end-user to easily select existing open-source projects from the most popular online project ecosystem: GitHub.
The Spring-based application back-end would continuously mine public repositories through the use of GitHub's API and various web scrapers, storing the extracted information in a relational database.
Through the use of a search engine interface, the user would be able to query said database, extracting a repository sample that fits their specific requirements.
These search results would both be immediately presented in the browser, as well as exportable in various file formats fit for further use in other applications.
